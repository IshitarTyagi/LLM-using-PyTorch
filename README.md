# LLM-using-PyTorch
Welcome to the LLM Basics using PyTorch repository!ðŸ‘‹ This repository is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to work with them using the PyTorch library.
Introduction to Large Language Models
Large Language Models are a class of artificial intelligence models that have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They have revolutionized the way we handle tasks such as text generation, language translation, sentiment analysis, and much more.

In this repository, we'll cover the basic concepts behind LLMs, including how they work, their architecture, and how to fine-tune them for specific NLP tasks.
